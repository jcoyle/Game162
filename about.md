# About Game162



## The Name

The name Game162 is derived from two sources. The first meaning is that [there are 162 games played in Major League Baseball]({% post_url 2015-03-23-1 %}). The second meaning is dedicated to one of the best played days in baseball history: September 28th, 2011. 

In the final day of the 2011 season, game 162, the St. Louis Cardinals successfully took the Wild Card from the Atlanta Braves, and the Tampa Bay Rays took the Wild Card from the Boston Red Sox. The Braves were 8 <sup>1/2</sup> games up to the Cardinals on September 1st, and the Red Sox were 9 games up to the Rays on September 3rd. Upon entering game 162, both teams succesfully closed the gap with a tied record in each league. 

The St. Louis Cardinals would defeat the Houston Astros easily in a 8 to 0 final. Meanwhile, the Braves failed to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies in a 13 inning game. The Cardinals went on to win the Wild Card, and continued to pull off miracles through the postseason, eventually becoming the 2011 World Series champions.

In the American League, the Boston Red Sox were up 3 to 2 in the bottom of the 9th inning. Their record when leading in the 8th inning that year was 77-0. Their closer at the time, Jonathan Papelbon, struck out the first two batters in the 9th. However, Papelbon proceeded to give up back to back doubles, followed by a walk off single to Robert Andino, losing their first game of the season when leading after the 8th.  

The Tampa Bay Rays, down 7 to 0 in the bottom of the 8th against the New York Yankees, scored 6 in the 8th. Then, in the 9th inning, pinch hitter Dan Johnson hit a 2 out, 2 strike count solo home run to tie the game. In extra innings, Evan Longoria hit a walk off solo shot in the 12th inning, minutes after the Red Sox lost their game in Baltimore.

The Rays took a one game lead on the Red Sox at the end of the season in one of the greatest comebacks in baseball history.
